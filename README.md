This project is a small personal website that I plan to use going forwards in my career.
While small now, I intend to redevelop it and improve upon it moving forwards whenever necessary.

The project is built upon HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make an interactive website that contains:
- A small personal bio
- My Resume
- Links to my other socials and contact information
- Portfolio of other projects

The code files used to make it:
- index.html
- website.css
- website.js

Other Important Files
- Projects (Folder)
    - A 2D-Platformer built Godot engine with GDScript
    - A data analysis of Spotify Daily Charts using SQL, Jupiter Notebook, and Python
    - A playable game of Blackjack, developed primarily in JavaScript

All my projects are uploaded as to my website as well, and are either downloadable or interactive depending on their nature.
